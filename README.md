# mdwiki

An iOS app for editing Zettelkasten like sets of markdown notes. Intended for my
use as companion to https://neuron.zettel.page.

Currently in very early development and not really functional.

## Building
Requires a Haskell cross compiler, hopefully I can flesh out the instructions
here, once I have this in better working shape.
